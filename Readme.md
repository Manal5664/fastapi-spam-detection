# ML Text Classification API

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based text classification API using FastAPI.  
The API classifies text messages as either **Spam** or **Not Spam** using a trained Logistic Regression classifier with TF-IDF vectorization.

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs in Python  
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and TF-IDF vectorization  
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization for request/response handling  
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI application  
- **pandas & numpy**: Data manipulation and numerical computing  
- **pickle**: Serialization for saving and loading trained models
